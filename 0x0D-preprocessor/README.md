# 0x0D. C - Preprocessor

This project introduces you to the C preprocessor, which is used to modify your source code before compilation. Below are the tasks for this project:

## Tasks

### 0. Object-like Macro
Create a header file that defines a macro named `SIZE` as an abbreviation for the token `1024`.

### 1. Pi
Create a header file that defines a macro named `PI` as an abbreviation for the token `3.14159265359`.

### 2. File name
Write a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line. You are allowed to use the standard library.

### 3. Function-like macro
Write a function-like macro `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x`.

### 4. SUM
Write a function-like macro `SUM(x, y)` that computes the sum of the numbers `x` and `y`.

These tasks will help you become familiar with using macros and the C preprocessor, which is an essential part of C programming.
