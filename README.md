# Alx Low-Level Programming Repository

**Welcome to the Alx Low-Level Programming repository!**

This repository provides a comprehensive collection of C projects that cover various aspects of low-level programming, providing a hands-on learning experience. Each directory corresponds to a specific project or topic.


## Project Structure

The repository is organized into 21 directories, each representing a specific project or topic in low-level programming. The directories are numbered from 0x00 to 0x15, with each number corresponding to a particular aspect of the C programming language. This structured organization facilitates a progressive learning experience, allowing beginners to start with basic concepts and gradually advance to more complex topics.
